# Custom-Built Computer Recommendation Expert System (MEIA-PROJ1)

This repository contains the source code and resources for a custom-built computer recommendation expert system, which recommends computer configurations based on user preferences. The system utilizes a dynamic dialog to gather user requirements and employs Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) in Prolog to efficiently identify the best computer configurations while considering both user needs and component compatibility rules.

## Features

- Dynamic dialog for user interaction
- Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) in Prolog for efficient computer configuration identification
- "How" and "Why Not" explanation modules to help users understand the recommendations

## Repository Structure

- `BD`: Contains the files for the components of the computers, sourced from pcpartpicker
- `Documnetação`: Contains all the project documentation
- `ExpertSystemDrools`: Expert system implemented in Drools, Java
- `ExpertSystemDroolsProlog`: Expert system implemented in Prolog, with CLP

## Getting Started

To run the expert system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `ExpertSystemDrools` or `ExpertSystemDroolsProlog` directory, depending on your preferred implementation.
3. Follow the instructions in the respective directories for setting up the required dependencies and running the expert system.
